      "description": "SHARP Dance Company is back at the Seacoast Fringe to perform 8 exciting pieces including excerpts from SHARP’s sold out sexy cabaret performance “Une Soiree au Cabaret” and the world premiere of “Beauty from Pain.”\nSHARP Dance Company is a national touring modern dance company based out of Philadelphia that enjoys not only strong technical dance but incorporating that with various collaborators. SHARP’s striking work investigates the gravitational support each person is able to call upon in life.\nSexy and thought provoking, SHARP hopes to bring its kinetic energy to the Seacoast Fringe 2011. SHARP strives to bring together a company of strong dancers to perform work with a new vision. Their mission is to translate raw human emotion utilizing contemporary movement to connect the audience through individual interpretation.\nThis company and its theory of “meaning behind movement” is shown prominently throughout its work. SHARP feels that “dance should be more than a performance, it should be an experience. “\nSHARP’s work was recently selected for The Phoenix Fringe Festival 2010, The Seacoast Fringe Festival 2010 & 2011, the Cool 2009 NY Festival, and The Fringe Wilmington Festivals in 2009, 2010 & 2011 and the 2011 Philadelphia Festival of the Arts (PIFA). Artistic Director Diane Sharp-Nachsin was selected as a New Edge Mix Artist Award recipient in Philadelphia, PA in 2008 and was commissioned to set work on the Mid-Atlantic Ballet in 2008- 2011.",

Now in its fifth year, the troupe has gradually gained an enthusiastic fan base while also beefing up its roster, now 10 performers strong. \"We like to have some nice and happy,\" says Sharp-Nachsin of her upcoming production, Revelation, \"and also make you think.\" Hence such topics as female empowerment, the ravages of pollution ... and roller coasters.",

The Seacoast Fringe Festival continues today, at venues throughout the city's downtown, with comedians, one-person plays, musicians, dancers and more. All venues are within walking distance of Market Square.\n\nOn the event Web site, organizers describe \"fringe\" as any creative, original performances that can be staged in front of an audience. The performances are further described as \"Off-Broadway\" or even \"Off-Off-Broadway\" by organizers as they are \"out of the established mainstream.\"\n\n\"It's a chance to do the show and get it rolling,\" said Michael Trautman, of Portland, Maine, whose \"Ping Pong: Inventive and hip clowning not just for kids\" takes place at 5 p.m. at the Moffatt-Ladd House.\n\nTrautman describes himself as a mime, clown, magician, juggler and storyteller whose family-friendly act is written for adults, but also enjoyed by children.\n\n\"I'm a one-man variety show,\" he said.\n\nAt Great Bay Academy of Dance on Saturday, the Sharp Dance Company of Philadelphia, Pa., highlighted performances on cultural, societal and environmental issues like water pollution and women's struggles.\n\nThe group's pieces offer much movement and technicality.\n\nThe group is not scheduled to perform today, but enjoys travelling to fringe festivals, Artistic Director Diane Sharp-Nachsin said. Five of the group's 10 dancers traveled to Portsmouth for the weekend festival.\n\n\"It's been really fun,\" she said. \"We love the opportunity to be in Portsmouth.\"",

      "description": "PHX: Fringe Welcomes SHARP Dance Co.\n\nThis month, prepare for downtown to be overrun. Don't worry, though, as this takeover will be at the hands of The Phoenix Fringe Festival and it's more 140 artists who will create 37 performances at six different venues. One such performance will come from SHARP, a modern dance company based in Philadelphia, Pa.\n\nAfter a successful dance career, injuries forced Diane Sharp-Nachsin to end her time as a performer. “I was inspired by friends and fellow dancers to start my own dance company,” says Sharp-Nachsin who introduced the contemporary dance company, SHARP in 2005. The company currently consists of eight dancers — six of whom will be attending The Phoenix Fringe Festival (April 2-11) this year — a managing director, a resident lighting designer and a resident projection artist. SHARP performs regularly in Philadelphia and has a reputation of bringing large audiences to their performances. “We are a very tight group and love to spend time together on and off the dance floor,” says Sharp-Nachsin who is excited about the upcoming festival.\n\nThe Phoenix Fringe Festival is a non-profit organization that has a strong belief in live theater performances that are filled free-spirited artistic expression. This year, SHARP will be making it's first appearance at the festival and Sharp-Nachsin is excited to come to the West Coast and “experience some of the other companies that we would normally not get to see and to hopefully find a new audience that enjoys our work.” The dancers feel that a performance should be an experience and are hoping to illustrate this to the Phoenix audience through a piece called Pollution. According to Sharp-Nachsin, Pollution, “deals with worldwide water pollution and how it is a serious and disturbing issue. We are using movement, photos and text to help tell the story of what some people in the world have to deal with everyday.”\n\nTo be sure the company is prepared for performances, Sharp-Nachsin holds rehearsals on a regular basis. Rehearsals typically takes place on Sundays and involve reviewing past performances, teaching and learning new choreography and, most importantly, perfecting pieces. Some dancers have individual pieces that call for separate rehearsal times during the week and special attention from Sharp-Nachsin to ensure perfection. Since the group of dancers is very tight-knit, SHARP does not hold formal auditions. If the company is ever looking for an additional dancer, Sharp-Nachsin said she relies on the recommendations of her current dancers to find the perfect fit.\n\nAfter SHARP's trip to Phoenix comes to an end, they will continue to work with guest choreographers and prepare for upcoming shows in New York, New Hampshire and Philadelphia. By the end of the year, SHARP will be obtaining their 501(c)3 status which will allow for more donations and grants that will open up opportunities for the group to travel both nationally and internationally. \n\nFeel it at www.sharpdance.org",

      "description": "CATCH \"TISSUES AND RAZORBLADES\" AT FRINGE WILMINGTON\nQ: Can you tell us a little bit about your dance company's piece, titled \"Tissues and Razorblades,\" which you'll be performing this coming weekend at the Fringe Wilmington festival?\n\nA: I always have a hard time naming a show. We joke around and have a good time at rehearsal, but once we get on stage, we're very serious about our work. When you see this piece you're either going to want to cry or slice your wrists. All of the pieces in the show are very emotionally driven, so we expect you to be overcome with emotion.\n\nQ: What about the show will make us feel emotional and perhaps shed a tear?\n\nA: We're dealing with elements of religion, sexual discrimination, topics that hit home. But one piece that has gotten audiences crying in the past is about a woman not being able to have a baby and the emotional tale of what she is going through. There is an empty bassinet at the end, which leaves the perception of what is happening to the individual audience member.\n\nQ: On your Web site, it says the Sharp Dance Company's goal is to establish \"meaning behind movement.\" What do you mean by that?\n\nA: I mean, dance should be more than a performance; it should be an experience. It should be addictive, full of uninhibited emotion, and it should move you. This is not just a bunch of bodies moving around on stage. It has more than that, it has to relay a story of some kind.\n\nQ: How do you go about telling a story?\n\nA: In addition to the choreography, we use the works of other local artists like digital projectionists, painters and photographers, to help tell the story. I feel like you possess a larger voice when you're working with other people and are bouncing ideas off of each other.\n\nQ: Are any props used in the show?\nA: Yes, as a matter of fact, one of the most interesting is a straight jacket. Our dancer starts out completely restricted and wrapped up in the jacket. Throughout the piece, she is slowly and eventually escaping from an insane asylum, with the straight jacket making that fact clear to the audience.\nQ: A dancer, in pointe shoes, escaping from a straight jacket? Sounds like David Copperfield. A: Haha. Well, it's not a magic trick, but certainly requires a lot of balance and poise.\nQ: You also mention how you like to employ \"eccentric partnering\" in your pieces. What is that?\nA: I love to partner male and female dancers, for obvious reasons. When we do lifts, I try and input nontraditional pieces, where the female is perpendicular to floor as he spins her. It just makes the piece more exciting, eccentric, and more than just a typical cradle pose.\nQ: What's your favorite part of the show?\nA: To close the show, three dancers appear wrapped together in a 35-foot skirt. It's called \"Blind Faith.\" It's something to see.\n\nSHARP DANCE COMPANY\nHometown: Philadelphia\nArtistic endeavor: \"Tissues and Razorblades,\" an emotional and spiritual piece that strives to give \"meaning behind movement\" by transforming dance from a performance to an experience for the audience. Choreography mixes with other genres, such as photography, music and projection art, to convey stories of religion and discrimination.\nBackground: Diane Sharp-Nachsin, artistic director of Sharp Dance Company, danced professionally for several years in Pittsburgh before returning home to Philadelphia, where she started her own company in 2005.\nFringe Wilmington performance: Oct. 3 at 8:45 p.m., Oct. 4 at 12 p.m. at the baby grand.\nWeb site: www.sharpdance.org",

      "description": "Phoenix Fringe Teeters over the edge\n\nPhoenix is about to be taken over by all strangeness that is performance art as six venues rally beneath a cloud of creative smoke kicked up by theater and dance troupes, solo artists and other entertainers. They're giving you Shakespeare and vaudeville acts, dance routines, monologues and more contemporary entertainment.\nThe Phoenix Fringe Festival was inspired by other popular events in cities throughout the US, which were in turn inspired by the original Edinburgh Fringe Festival - now the largest arts festival in the world.\nThe Phoenix festival is in its third year and will run, on Friday, simultaneously with First Friday. Events continue through Sunday, April 11.\n\"Last year there were 30 performers. This year we have 37, and we have also added the interactive art gallery from urbanSTEW, which is another 15 artists,\" said Daniel Roth, an ASU grad student who serves as the festival's director. \"There's got to be 150 people working on the Fringe every day, some of them local and some of them coming nationally and internationally.\"\nIndeed, the scope of what is available at this year's festival is impressive. Some examples:\nPhoenix's Teatro Bravo is bringing a few laughs to the otherwise somber Space 55 by sticking four guys in a hotel room after one of them gets left at the altar. It's called \"Dudes Gone Wild,\" and it's going to be loud, offensive and funny. Think stage version of \"The Hangover.\"\nAt PHiX Art Space is Tempe's Aaron Wester's [OMIT], a play inspired by Dante's \"Inferno,\" and the hilarious \"Dinosaurs Exposed!\"\nSome of the out-of-town performances include the fusion \"Tissues and Razorblades,\" by Philadelphia's dance company SHARP, and the play \"My Rooster is Huge\" from two-time Best in Fringe Festival at New York Antonio Sacre.\nWant it weirder? Watch Brooklyn's Martin Dockery's \"The Bike Trip\" as he plays the Swedish pharmacologist who accidentally discovered LSD, or you can take in some risqué choreography that pokes fun at American culture in the \"FDance Exposure.\" Or, not \"watch\" anything at all in the pitch-black performance \"We Do it In The Dark.\"\n\"Violent Delights\" shows that Shakespeare wasn't all about sappy sonnets or twisted trysts.\nFor something a little more real, \"Live Out Loud\" is about the homeless youth in Phoenix at the Tumbleweed Center for Youth Development.\nThis all begins the day before First Friday, and admission for each show is sold separately. Also, get down at one of the after-hour parties at Paisley Violin, Nine 05 and Lost Leaf.\nDowntown Phoenix, Friday, April 2 to Sunday April 5 and Thursday, April 8 to Sunday, April 11, $5 to 15 per show\nTissues and Razorblades\nTissues and Razorblades, performed by the SHARP Dance Company, merges dance with other media including photography, set pieces and music.\nCollege Times: How is SHARP unique?\nDiane Sharp-Nachsin: SHARP Dance Company loves collaborating with other artists. We feel it expands our voice in a way working alone never could. In some of SHARP's current work you will see collaborations with photographer Kylene Cleaver, composer Jason Andrew, DJ/artist Geoff Partridge, voiceover artist Rich Orlow and resident projection artist Lauren Mandilian [among others]. A SHARP Dance Company performance is a multi-media event.\nHow did SHARP become involved in Phoenix Fringe?\nSHARP has had the privilege of performing in The Philadelphia Fringe Festivals in 2007 and 2008 and the Inaugural Fringe Wilmington in 2009 in Delaware. We began researching other fringes around the country that we thought would be a good fit for SHARP. Once we saw the information on the PHX Fringe website with its juried selection process and the variety of artists we felt it was the perfect time to apply. We wanted to show our work to a Phoenix audience who we hope will enjoy a night of modern dance from a company with a different perspective from a different part of the country.\nWhat is the show Tissues and Razorblades about?\nTissues and Razorblades is a collection of SHARP pieces. It uses the beautiful talent of seven professional dancers and the collaborative work of other artists from the Philadelphia area. Some of the work touches on serious issues in the world today including pollution, discrimination, mental illness and personal issues. In Tissues and Razorblades an audience will witness the raw emotion that exudes from SHARP's dancers as they weave their tales.\nWhy should people see the show?\nSHARP is a modern dance company and its theory of \"Meaning behind Movement\" is showed prominently throughout their work. SHARP feels that dance should be more than a performance. It should be an experience. SHARP's pieces are an exciting blend of technically driven dance, intense themes and multi-media. In our performances we integrate various aspects of relationships and different events in one's life. We strive to accomplish this by incorporating weight-sharing partnering, creative progressions and unified material in our choreography.\nTissues and Razorblades will be performed at the Phoenix Theatre Little Theatre, Thursday, April 8 to Sunday, April 11, times vary, $10",

      "description": "Etc. Performance Series premiered its Spring Showcase on Saturday, April 4th and Sunday, April 5th, at the Community Education Center on Lancaster Avenue.  The show was packed with dance, singing and acting talent, featuring works by Andre Jones, Elle, Elisha Halpin, Kate Speer, VADA Dance Collective, Kelly Adorno, SHARP Dance Company, SURGE Dance Team, IdRatherBeHere, and Etc. Performance Series director, Charles Tyson Jr.  The objective of the Etc. Performance Series is to provide “an opportunity for performance artists of any and all genres to show their work to a new and diverse audience in an intimate venue”, a goal which was successfully achieved this past weekend.\nToumbe (Let Us Pray), choreographed by Charles Tyson Jr. himself, opened the evening with a peaceful and content feeling.  The piece featured various jumps and turns, soft in dynamics, executed by two technically efficient dancers.  Elle consisted of three romantic songs sung by the artist Elle, the third of which was debuted from her new CD, Once Upon a Time.  Pieces of U, choreographed by Diane-Sharp Nachsin and performed by four members from SHARP Dance Company, confronted the pains of discrimination through dance, multimedia, and prop.  The piece generated an uncomfortable and uneasy sensation, which was completely effective. Undertow (in progress) was another duet choreographed by Elisha Clark Halpin, inspired Kate Chopin’s short story, “The Awakening”.  The dancing portrayed a struggle with control and physical and emotional manipulation.  Lullabies and Landmines, part of Vada Dance Collective’s repertoire, was choreographed by Katie Skettino.  The technically-demanding solo consisted of an eerily pleasant emotion and music.  Amino Acids, a work from IdRatherBeHere, was a brief theatrical work satirizing the stereotyped personas of actors and actresses.\nAfter a ten minute intermission, the second half of Etc. Performance Series launched with another acting scene entitled Trust!  Directed by Charles Tyson Jr., the work played off of the complexities of straight and homosexual relationships.  Verbalized Ink, another theatrical work directed by Andre N. Jones, included brilliant rapping of contemporary political, spiritual and social issues.  An acting piece from IdRatherBeHere followed, Mominator.  This was a humorous exaggeration and spoof on the tendencies of mothers. The first dance piece of the second act and third dance duet of the evening, Window, was an exceptionally triumphant duet choreographed by Kelly Adorno.  The piece contained challenging partner work and a contrast of abrupt and delicate dynamics, which surprised the audience recurrently.  Flushed Spade, directed and performed by Lee Fogel and Kate Speer, was a silent scene depicting the delirium and mental chaos of small games, gambling, and competition.  With Hesitation, choreographed by Rebecca Moyer from Vada Dance Collective, involved a beautiful trio of both small individual solos and unison.  The movement highlighted exquisite extensions and overall quality of movement.  Boatman was a dance piece inspired by the journey to death and fatal accidents, performed by SHARP Dance Company with guest choreographer, Steven Vaughn.  Lastly, SURGE dance team and choreographer Kelly Snell added a bit of spice to the evening with a fun hip-hop routine.\nEtc. Performance Series presents bi-monthly showcases and is quickly growing in popularity and participation.  Don’t miss out on the next show on Saturday, June 6th and Sunday, June 7th, 2009.",

      "description": "Mary Miller makes dance with something to say\n\nFor many people, an encounter with an angry motorist is an everyday annoyance. For Mary Miller, it was an inspiration: Facing road rage led the dancer and choreographer to create the Peace Project, a five-year exploration of peace through movement. The latest installment is Together, Mary Miller Dance Company's collaboration with Philadelphia-based SHARP Dance Company, with three shows Nov. 16-17, at Open Stage Theater.\n\nUnlike a choreographer whose creative process begins in the studio, says Miller, \"I start from the point of human experience and expand from there.\" Audiences get to relate, and even sometimes take part in, the performance. \"There is a commonality among all of us; for example, we all want a good life,\" says Miller, her company's artistic director. \"Dance is my voice, my language. So, I use dance to remind people of the connections we share.\"\n\nThe goal of connecting people extends to Miller Dance Company's collaboration with SHARP, an edgy modern and hip-hop dance group. The collaboration did not emerge from the blue: SHARP artistic director Diane Sharp-Nachsin was a dancer for Mary Miller from 1992-1996. Sharp-Nachsin, who formed her own company in 2005, echoes Miller's mission statement. \"My work comes from having something to say,\" says Sharp-Nachsin. \"It's not just arbitrary movement in the middle of the floor.\"\n\nBoth companies prize unpredictability. \"A big part of creativity is humor,\" says Miller. \"I am moved by issues that present themselves to be funny. And I'm not preachy. I approach it as, 'I'm thinking about this, what do you think?'\"\n\nThe Nov. 16 and 17 performances here also feature local guest artists including musician Ellen Gozion, spoken-word artist Vanessa German, and musician and performance artist Stephen Pellegrino.\n\nLooking ahead, Miller and Sharp-Nachsin hope that this year's collaboration will be one of many. They intend to broaden their audience by reprising Together in Philadelphia.\n\nMeantime, audiences for Together here should expect a roller-coaster ride of emotions and life experiences. Miller's works include a dance about the experience of dreaming. Sharp-Nachsin's sensual dance \"Linear\" tells the story of a woman who's living life on the straight and narrow until a love interest has her stepping out of her comfort zone. Perhaps audiences who connect with the work on stage will have a better chance of connecting with one another, as well.\n\nMary Miller Dance Company presents Together 8 p.m. Fri., Nov. 16; and 2 and 8 p.m. Sat., Nov. 17. Open Stage Theater, 2835 Smallman St., Strip District. $18 ($15 seniors/$10 students/$5 students Nov. 17 matinee). 412-394-3353 or www.MaryMillerDanceCo.org",
