      "bio": "Steven was born in Iowa City, Iowa, and grew up dancing all over the Midwest and Massachusetts at various dance studios. While attending the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, where he graduated with a BFA in Modern Dance in May 2009, he was given the opportunity to perform works by Silvanna Cardell, Martha Graham, and Twyla Tharp, among others, and to present his own choreography. His college career also afforded him the privilege of working professionally with Diane Sharp-Nachsin's SHARP Dance Company; Scott Jovovich in Brandywine Ballet Theater; Zane Booker and his Smoke, Lilies and Jade Arts Initiative; and Brian Sanders' JUNK. Steven joined Parsons Dance in June 2008 as an apprentice as was invited to become a company member this August 2009.  Steven has previously choreographed pieces on SHARP dance company and the Joffery Ballet summer program.",
